# Sift
Check, filter and sort through a list of scrollable items. Available as an Angular JS module. Items are loaded asynchronuously. See the [live demo](http://fcosrno.github.io/sift/).

## Quick Usage

This is all you need to start using all the Sift features.

	// Add Sift as a dependency to your app
	angular.module('your-app', ['sift']);
	
	// Use the sift-panel directive in your HTML
	<div sift-panel url="http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"></div>

Make sure the `url` attribute points to a JSON with an *id* and *title* field. If you don't have a title field you can let Sift know with the `title-as` attribute:

	// Display and sort by the "name" field instead of "title"
	<div sift-panel url="http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" title-as="name"></div>
	
Sift will put the selected items in a hidden input field named *selected_items*. The input field is appended to the bottom of the panel generated by Sift. It gives it a value of ids separated by commas.

	// String of ids refer to the id value from the JSON file, not array keys
	<input type="hidden" name="selected_items" value="1,3,5">

You can replace the *selected_items* field name with the `field-as` attribute. This is useful when loading two Sift instances in the same form.

	// Put the results in hidden input field named "my-users"
	<div sift-panel url="http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" field-as="my-users"></div>
	
	// Generates a hidden input with custom name
	<input type="hidden" name="my-users" value="1,3,5">

## Dependencies

Sift depends on Angular. The HTML is based on [Bootstrap's Panel markup](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels) and uses [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), but either library is really optional.

## Stylesheet

All the CSS classes used by Sift to style the panel can be found in the *style.css* file in the app folder. You can copy it as a baseline and modify to your needs.

## Roadmap
